                Suicide Christ is an American punk rapper and half of the rap duo '$uicideboy$.' He performs along with
                his cousin, Ruby Da Cherry. The duo has released several music projects through 'G59 Records.' Their
                compositions mainly express their struggle with drugs, self-destruction, anxiety, and depression.
                Suicide Christ has gained immense popularity with his impressive body of work. His compositions are
                aggressive, but each of them carries a message. His aggressive lyrics and his devilish appearance have
                earned him a lot of notoriety, too. With over 30 releases, including EPs and singles, Suicide Christ has
                contributed a lot in transforming '$uicideboy$' from a garage band to a professional punk-rap band.
