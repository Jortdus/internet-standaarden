                Aristos Petrou is an American rapper and musical artist. He is better known by his stage name Ruby Da
                Cherry. In 2014, he formed the rap group Suicideboys (stylised spelling: $UICIDEBOY$) along with his
                cousin Scott Arceneaux Jr. (stage name: Suicide Christ or $lick or $crim). A native of New Orleans,
                Aristos was deeply influenced by the rich musical culture of his city and was inspired to make music at
                an early age. However, his youth was marked by drug addiction and poverty. His circumstances deeply
                influenced his music. After forming Suicideboys, Ruby De Cherry and Suicide Christ have released over 40
                projects, including multiple mixtapes and extended plays. They put out their music through G59 Records.
                Ruby Da Cherry is quite popular on social media. He has over 814 thousand followers on Instagram and
                more than 214 thousand followers on Twitter. Besides Ruby Da Cherry, he has several other stage names,
                including $uicide Leopard and Oddy Nuff da Snow Leopard.
